# modulador
AI-Engine which allows to modularize ( decoupling and decomposing) an application in decoupled modular components.

> **Modulador** is someone skilled in breaking down systems into independent and manageably interconnected pieces.

* Assist in the process of reducing dependencies between different parts of a system, making the system more flexible, maintainable, and scalable.
* Minimize the interdependencies to allow each part to function independently. This ensures that each application part can be updated, upgraded, or transformed without significantly affecting other application parts.
* By segregating into smaller, functionally coherent modules. Each module handles a specific piece of domain developed, deployed, and maintained independently.
* Decomposition can support data sharing by defining clear boundaries and interfaces for each module. This makes it easier to expose specific parts of the system for integration with other applications.

## Modules

* Modules are more smaller, well-defined, loosely connected that can operate independently where changes in one part have minimal impact on others.
* *Modulador* should identify `domains` generate `logical boundaries`,`interfaces`, `abstractions`, and `communication protocols` within the system to separate into discrete `data entities` and minimize direct dependencies.
* Generate a layer to handle communication between an application and its database, so the database layer can be changed without affecting the application layer.
* *Modulador* generate `modules` that can be developed, tested, updated, upgraded, transformed, maintained, and deployed separately. Each `module` encapsulates `domain`, `data entities` and interacts with other modules through well-defined `contracts`.
